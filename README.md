# 📘 Persona-Based PDF Insight Extractor – Adobe Hackathon 2025 Challenge 1B

This project uses a transformer-based approach to extract **persona-relevant sections** from PDFs based on a specific task or role. Built for Adobe Hackathon 2025 – Challenge 1B, it intelligently identifies and ranks the most relevant chunks of text using semantic similarity.

---

## 🧠 Features

* ✅ Processes multiple collections with distinct personas and job tasks
* ✅ Uses SentenceTransformer (`paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for deep semantic search
* ✅ Extracts and ranks text chunks most aligned to the persona's goal
* ✅ Supports multi-page PDF documents with text block handling
* ✅ Outputs structured JSON with both metadata and refined excerpts

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Ensure the following libraries are installed:

   ```bash
   pip install pymupdf sentence-transformers
   ```
2. Place your PDF files inside `CollectionX/PDFs/`.
3. Provide `challenge1b_input.json` in the same folder with this structure:

```json
{
  "persona": "AI Researcher",
  "job": "Summarize key innovation trends",
  "documents": ["paper1.pdf", "paper2.pdf"]
}
```

4. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

5. Output is saved to `challenge1b_output.json` with ranked section insights.

## 📄 Output Format

### Metadata:

* Documents list
* Persona and job description
* Timestamp

### Extracted Sections:

```json
{
  "document": "paper1.pdf",
  "page_number": 2,
  "section_title": "Neural Trends in 2023",
  "importance_rank": 0.8723
}
```

### Subsection Analysis:

```json
{
  "document": "paper1.pdf",
  "page_number": 2,
  "refined_text": "Deep learning has shifted toward efficient transformers..."
}
```

---

## 🔎 Use Case

* Personalized document summarization
* Contextual PDF analysis
* AI-driven resume filtering or document scanning
* Role-based content extraction

---

## 🛠️ Notes

* Each collection is processed independently.
* Input must contain valid `persona`, `job`, and `documents` keys.
* Chunks are ranked using cosine similarity to persona+task prompt.
